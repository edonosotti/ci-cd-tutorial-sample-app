  push:
    # Match all branches *without* a / in the name.
    # This will exclude "sub" branches, such as "feature branches",
    # named something like: "feature/my-feature". Those branches will
    # likely contain "work in progress" code, so we will run the tests
    # on the local machine and avoid using up GitHub Actions credits
    # (if applicable, such as in `private` repositories).
